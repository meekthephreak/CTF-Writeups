## Introduction

- **Box/Challenge Name:** [Name of the Box or Challenge]
- **Platform:** [TryHackMe, HacktheBox, VulnHub, etc.]
- **Difficulty Level:** [Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced]
- **Objectives:** Briefly outline what you aim to achieve with this box/challenge.
- **Tools Used:** List the tools you used during the engagement.

## Pre-Engagement

### Scope Definition

- Define the boundaries of the test, including which systems, networks, and applications will be tested.

### Rules of Engagement

- Detail any rules or guidelines given before starting the challenge. This might include limitations on brute-forcing, denial-of-service attacks, etc.

## Reconnaissance

### Passive Recon

- Discuss any information gathered without directly interacting with the target. This can include information from forums, previous writeups, and other open-source intelligence (OSINT).

### Active Recon

- **Host Discovery:** Document how you identified active machines or services in the target network.
- **Port Scanning:** List the ports you discovered open and the services running on them.
- **Service Enumeration:** Detail the specific versions and configurations of the services identified during port scanning. Mention any initial vulnerabilities or misconfigurations you may have noticed.

## Vulnerability Analysis

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Discuss any automated scanning tools or techniques used to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Manual Testing and Research:** Explain any manual testing techniques employed to verify or discover vulnerabilities. Include any specific vulnerabilities found, with references to CVEs or other advisories if applicable.

## Exploitation

- **Exploit Details:** Describe the vulnerability exploited, including any relevant CVE numbers or exploit database references.
- **Exploit Execution:** Step-by-step guide on how the exploit was carried out, including any custom scripts or commands used.
- **Initial Access:** Detail how initial access was gained and what level of access you obtained (e.g., user shell, admin shell).

## Post-Exploitation

- **Privilege Escalation:** Explain the methods used to escalate privileges, including any specific tools or exploits.
- **Persistence:** Discuss any techniques employed to maintain access to the system.
- **Lateral Movement:** If applicable, detail how you moved within the network to target additional systems.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Describe how any sensitive data was identified and securely exfiltrated from the target environment.

## Analysis and Reporting

- **Findings Summary:** Provide a summary of the vulnerabilities discovered, exploited, and any data exfiltrated.
- **Impact Analysis:** Discuss the potential impact of the vulnerabilities if they were exploited by a malicious actor.
- **Remediation Recommendations:** Offer detailed recommendations for mitigating the identified risks.
- **Lessons Learned:** Reflect on the engagement, including what went well, what could be improved, and any new techniques learned.

## Conclusion
